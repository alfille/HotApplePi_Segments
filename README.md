# HotApplePi_Segments
Segment approximation for optimum Hot Apple Pi Box

See [Hot Apple Pi](https://github.com/alfille/HotApplePi)

This is the Javascript App to calculating boxes with maximum volume.

You can choose:

* Algotithm (a custom gradient or a slow Genetic)
* Length of box (relative to width)
* Number of segments (100 is a good choice)
* Iterations
